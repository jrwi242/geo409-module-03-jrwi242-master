    "We'll examine the foundations of programming by looking at how we assign, compare, and change values. Using a Jupyter Notebook, we'll practice creating blocks of code that execute depending on the value of user-supplied data. Finally, we'll test our new understanding on a feature class of arch locations with ArcGIS.\n",

    "## Values and data types\n",
    "\n",
    "A *value* is data that we use in our program. All values have a distinct *type* that Python requires. The type used depends on the data we need to encode and what it represents. For example, the data layers we added to our clip function were encoded as a string data type because the layer is accessed as a file path in your OS directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have four common data types we use. Let's use the `print()` function to show how to encode values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "*Integer* values are non-fractional, whole numbers. They are typically used for nominal and ordinal data types but they can also measure quantities if they do not contain fractions. A great example of using integers for quantity is counting people. We don't like *only* 2/3 of a person! \n",
    "\n",
    "A nominal data type shows a difference of type and not a difference of size. It is often easier to use a *1, 2, 3, etc.* to classify features than using a longer label. An ordinal data type represents a ranked or ordered set of data. In this case a *2* is not twice as much as *1*; they are different ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we assign an integer by using a number without a decimal point or surrounding quotes.\n"
